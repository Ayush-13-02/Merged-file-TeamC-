            Registration is an important procedural part of the academic system which ensure the willingness of the
            student to continue in the course of the study in the institute. No credit is given to the student who
            attendts a course without a formal registration. The name of the registered student only appears on the roll
            list of the courses registered.
            Pre-registration for each semester will be done according to a specified schedule prior to the end of the
            previous semester and paying the requisre tuition fee to the institute.
            In absentia registration will be allowed only in rare cases at the discretion of dean (Academic Programme).
            In case of illness or absence during registration, the student should intimate the same to the Dean
            (Academic programme). Each student will be given a Registration Record which will be an offcial record of
            courses registered. Add, Drop, Withdrawl and Audit will be marked on this sheet itself by the Academic
            Section. The registration Record should be retained by the student until he/she gets the Semester Grade card
            for the Corresponding semester.
